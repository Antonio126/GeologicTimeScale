# GeologicTimeScale
Initialise based on https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/subversion/xmml/ontologies/tags/final-GTS/Geoscience/GeologicTimeScale/ 
as described in Cox & Richard 2015 "A geologic timescale ontology and service" http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12145-014-0170-6 

Immediate goal is to harmonize with OWL-Time https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/
